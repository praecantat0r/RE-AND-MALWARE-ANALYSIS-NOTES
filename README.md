## Work in progress! 

The notes i create for myself while learning reverse engineering and malware analysis.\
All made with markdown.\
All made with love.\
All notes can be downloaded in PDF or in markdown extension if you want to edit them.\
You can download with `git clone https://github.com/praecantat0r/RE-AND-MALWARE-ANALYSIS-NOTES.git`, ls -la and cd into the directory you want.\
My sources are general googling, various courses and talking with people.\
