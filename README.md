- The notes i create for myself while learning reverse engineering and malware analysis.
- All made with markdown.
- All made with love.
- All notes can be downloaded in PDF or in markdown extension if you want to edit them.
- You can download with `git clone https://github.com/praecantat0r/RE-AND-MALWARE-ANALYSIS-NOTES.git`, ls -la and cd into the directory you want.
- My sources are general googling, various courses and talking with people.
- If you want to reuse them somewhere just credit me.
- When finished, I will upload it with index and folders so it's nice and categorized.

***Have fun!***
