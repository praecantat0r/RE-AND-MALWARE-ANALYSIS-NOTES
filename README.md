# RE-AND-MALWARE-ANALYSIS-NOTES

## Work in progress

The notes i create for myself while learning reverse engineering and malware analysis.\
All made with markup.\
All made with love.\
All notes can be downloaded in PDF or in markdown extension if you want to edit them.\
My sources are general googling, Sentinel One courses and talking with people.\
If you want to reuse them somewhere just credit me.\
Have fun!
