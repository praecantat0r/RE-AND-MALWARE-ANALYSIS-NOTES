# ***Reverse-Engineering-Pwn-Notes***

Notes that cover various topics, from debugging and finding out what a program does, to exploiting.
I am not experienced but i wanted to share my findings, making it easier for other people.
I try to simplify everything and give a thorough overview of different topics.
I use a both a Windows and a Linux machine.
Notes are made with Obsidian.
